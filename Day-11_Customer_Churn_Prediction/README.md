# Customer Churn Prediction 

## Overview
This project predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn (leave the company) or stay based on customer demographics, account information, subscribed services, and billing behavior.

Customer churn prediction helps businesses identify at-risk customers early and take proactive retention actions such as discounts, support improvements, or personalized offers.

---

## Problem Statement
Customer acquisition is expensive, and losing existing customers directly impacts revenue.  
The goal of this project is to build a Machine Learning classification model that predicts:

- **0 = Customer Will Stay**
- **1 = Customer Will Churn**

Using this model, businesses can reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies.

## Dataset
**Dataset Name:** IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset  
**File Used:** `Telco_customer_churn.xlsx`

This dataset contains telecom customer records including services, billing, and churn labels.

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
- Streamlit
- OpenPyXL

---

## Model Information
This project uses a trained classification model saved as:

`customer_churn_model.pkl`

The `.pkl` file stores the trained machine learning pipeline so predictions can be made instantly without retraining every time.

---

## What is Pickle / PKL File?
A `.pkl` (pickle) file is a serialized version of a trained machine learning model.

### Why Use It?
- Saves trained model
- Loads instantly
- No need to train again
- Used for deployment in apps

---

## How to Download / Generate PKL Model
If `customer_churn_model.pkl` is missing:

1. Open terminal in project folder
2. Run training script:

```bash
python day_11_customer_churn_prediction.py
```

3. After running, the PKL file will be created automatically.

---

## What is Streamlit?
Streamlit is a Python framework used to convert data science and machine learning scripts into interactive web applications.

### Why Streamlit?
- Easy to use
- Fast deployment
- Beautiful UI components
- Perfect for ML projects
- No frontend coding required

---

## App Prediction Output
The app takes customer details as input and predicts:

-  Customer Will Stay
-  Customer is Likely to Churn

It also shows churn probability (if supported by model).

---

## Business Use Cases
- Reduce customer loss
- Increase revenue
- Improve retention campaigns
- Identify unhappy customers
- Offer personalized plans

---

## Resume Description
Developed a Customer Churn Prediction system using Machine Learning and Streamlit to identify customers likely to leave a telecom service based on behavioral and billing data.

---

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Explainable AI (SHAP)
- Cloud deployment
- Real-time database integration
